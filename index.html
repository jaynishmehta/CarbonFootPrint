            <div class="box1 q">WHAT IS CARBON FOOTPRINT ?</div>
        <div class="answer1 ans">A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide
            and other carbon compounds, that are released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. These
            activities include things like driving a car, using electricity, manufacturing goods, and even the food we
            consume. The carbon footprint is often measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>) and
            is a way to
            assess the impact of individuals, organizations, or products on climate change by quantifying their
            contribution to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The goal is to reduce carbon
            footprints to mitigate the negative effects of climate change.</div>

        <div class="box2 q">WHY COMPANY SHOULD GIVE THEIR DATA TO OUR WEBSITE ?</div>

            employees,
            are becoming more environmentally conscious. Sharing carbon footprint data aligns with the expectations of
            stakeholders who prioritize companies committed to sustainable practice
            <br>
            <br>
            2.Establish trust by emphasizing confidentiality, data security, and ethical practices in handling their
            information. A trustworthy and reputable organization is more likely to gain the cooperation of companies in
            sharing sensitive data.
